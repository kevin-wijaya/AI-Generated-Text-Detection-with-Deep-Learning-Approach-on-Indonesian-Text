## About <a name = "about"></a>

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a popular technology that is now widely used by the public. That is due to the emergence of intelligent chatbots from OpenAI, namely ChatGPT. Various groups of people use ChatGPT for different purposes, one of them is students who use ChatGPT to understand material, do assignments, compose essays and paraphrase journals. Paraphrasing on ChatGPT and using paraphrased text as writing in papers can be considered a form of plagiarism. The problem is, to find out whether the text was AI-generated or human-written text, it takes a very long and in-depth understanding of the patterns and arrangement of words in the text. Therefore, we need a system that is able to detect text generated by AI or not. This text detection system uses a deep learning approach. Human text data is collected from the Detik news portal and the Quora question-and-answer website. AI text data is generated through a paraphrasing process on human text data. The vectorization in this research uses Doc2Vec and BERT Tokenizer. The models used in this study were LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU and BERT with the IndoBERT pre-trained model. Of the five models, the best accuracy on training data is BERT, while the best accuracy in evaluation with data validation is Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU.
